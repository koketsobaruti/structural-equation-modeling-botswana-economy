#🧠 Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Analysis of Botswana’s Economy

This project demonstrates the application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships between key social and governance indicators influencing national well-being. Using data from the World Happiness Report (2023), the analysis illustrates how SEM can be used to understand complex constructs—such as quality of life, democracy, and happiness—and their implications for economic decision-making in Botswana.

##📌 Project Overview

Botswana’s overreliance on diamonds has exposed a structural vulnerability in its economy. As the country pursues diversification through initiatives like the National Transformation Strategy (NTS) and the Botswana Economic Transformation Program (BETP), data-driven approaches are essential for informed policy and strategic planning.

This notebook introduces SEM as a tool for modeling complex, interrelated variables that cannot be directly observed, offering a statistical foundation for understanding latent constructs that drive development outcomes.

##🎯 Objectives

To define and model latent constructs (e.g., quality of life) using SEM.

To examine how variables such as democracy, social support, and freedom to make life choices influence overall well-being.

To evaluate model fit using indices like CFI, GFI, TLI, RMSEA, and Chi-square.

To demonstrate how SEM can inform Botswana’s economic decision-making and diversification efforts.

##📊 Dataset Overview

Source: World Happiness Report (2023)

Sample Size: 146 countries

Variables Used:

Ladder Score (life evaluation)

Freedom to Make Life Choices

Perceptions of Corruption

Social Support

Healthy Life Expectancy

Democracy Score (derived variable)

##🧩 Methodology

Model Definition: Establish covariances and variances between observed variables.

Model Estimation: Estimate parameters using SEM.

Model Evaluation: Assess fit using indices and interpret latent relationships.

Interpretation: Draw policy and theoretical insights relevant to Botswana’s context.

##⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3.13

pandas — data manipulation

numpy — numerical operations

semopy — structural equation modeling

matplotlib & seaborn — visualization

##📈 Key Findings

CFI (0.964), GFI (0.960), and NFI (0.960) indicate strong model performance.

AGFI (0.801) and TLI (0.821) suggest moderate model complexity, likely due to a small sample size.

RMSEA (0.225) signals poor absolute fit, implying model improvement potential with larger samples.

Despite these limitations, the model effectively demonstrates how SEM can reveal underlying social and economic relationships.

##💡 Policy Relevance

The findings underscore the potential of SEM as a robust analytical framework for policy formulation.
By uncovering the hidden relationships between democracy, happiness, and quality of life, SEM can help Botswana’s policymakers and economists make more evidence-based, data-driven decisions in pursuit of sustainable growth.
